        Ownership
        Rust uses "ownership" to manage memory in a safe way.
        Every value in Rust has an owner. The owner is usually a variable.

        Ownership Rules
        - Each value has one owner
        - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is deleted
        - You can only have one owner at a time, unless you

    /*
        Basic Ownership Example
        In this example, a owns the string. Then we move it to b:
    */

    let a = String::from("Hello");
    let b = a;

    // println!("{}", a); Error: a no longer owns the value
    println!("{}", b); // Ok: b now owns the value


    /*
        When we assign a to b, the ownership moves. This means only b can use the value now, because a is no longer valid.

        But simple types like numbers, characters and booleans are copied, not moved.
        This means you can still use the original variable after assigning it to another
    */

    // Here, a is copied into b, not moved, so you can still use b.

    let c = 5;
    let d = c;

    println!("a = {}, b = {}", c, d);

    /*
        Clone
        For other types, like String,
        if you really want to keep the original value and also assign it to another variable,
        you can use the .clone() method, which makes a copy of the data
    */

    let e = String::from("Hello");
    let f = e.clone();
    println!("e = {}", e);  // Works
    println!("f = {}", f);

    // However, if you don't need to own the value twice, using a reference (&) is usually better than cloning,
    /*
        Why Ownership Matters
        Rust uses ownership to automatically free memory when it's no longer needed
        It prevents bugs like using memory that's already been deleted
        It is one of the reasons Rust is so safe and fast
